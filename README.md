# dailyspace

dailyspace was a 2 day coding challenged assigned at the end of module 4 at Turing School of Software and Design. It was my first time being exposed to VueJS. Unfortunately, the NASA API is not working due to a governmental shutdown, so mock data is currently being used in it's place.
